# Adding Meta Data/Cover Art to Rendered Kdenlive MP4 Video

This project consists of a post-rendering script to be used with Kdenlive. Whenever Kdenlive finishes a rendering job,
the post-render script checks to see if (1) the rendered video is in a MP4 container and (2) there is meta data and
cover art to be added to the video file.

For more information about how to use the post-rendering script, please see my detailed blog post
[Kdenlive: Adding Meta Data and Cover Art to Rendered Files](http://thediveo-e.blogspot.de/2016/06/kdenlive-adding-meta-data-and-cover-art.html).
